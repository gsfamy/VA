Critique of Visualisation\r\nThe data visualization below is created by using data downloaded from\r\nLTA Datamall, URA region, planning area, and planning sub zone in order\r\nto visualize intra- and inter-zonal public ride bus flows in Singapore\r\nfrom January to December 2022.\r\n\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\nMissing Tittle: The visualization dashboard does\r\nnot have a main title, and for each chart does not have the subtitle to\r\nelaborate the parimary insights from each graph. For example, the users\r\nmay even have no idea about the adjacency matrix and\r\nthe usage of it. The visualization make the users more confusing rather\r\nthan help them easier understanding the data and get useful insights. In\r\naddition, it does not convey any key observation or insight of the\r\nvisualization.\r\nImproper Chart type: The compress adjacency\r\nmatrix is meaningless for users to read. For example, it needs the users\r\nto interact with the data, make mouse hover over the plot to show\r\nmessage in the tooltip, which should be the work for data analytics not\r\nthe normal readers. Therefore, it should be a more appropriate way to\r\nuse other graph without interaction.\r\nLegend on Alphabetical Order: The origin and\r\ndestination order does not make sense on alphabetical order. For\r\nexample, Dhoby Ghaut and Farrer Park are adjacent, but\r\nit is apart from each other on legend. So it is impossible for readers\r\nto find out any findings about adjacent zones different passenger\r\nflow.\r\nNo Data Source: There is no data source for\r\npeople can verify or trust. It should be added.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\nSame Color: The chart used the same blue color\r\nfor trips generated from and trips attracted to, it is\r\nnot very easy for readers to aware that one is the station people come\r\nin, one is the station people come out. It should use single color to\r\nshow the different day type and should use a very distinct color to\r\ndistinguish the in and out. That will make the visualization more\r\nappealing and understandable.\r\nCompressed adjacency matrix: The figures size of\r\nthe matrix is too small, finding it challenging for users to hover over\r\nand select the data they really want. Aesthetics suffer as a result of\r\nthe small size, since watchers can hardly tell the difference between\r\ndifferent zones, and users struggle to hover over then choose the data\r\npoint they wish to watch. For example, it’s quite tough to identify\r\nwhich trip accounts for the largest proportion of passengers on weekdays\r\nand hard to find the point from Dhoby Ghaut to Farrer\r\nPark on weekends.\r\nImproper graphic layout: The graphic layout is\r\nnot neat. For example, the left bar chart is not aligned with the right\r\none and also with the matrix. It should be aligned and the layout should\r\nbe more appealing and neat.\r\n2. Proposed Design\r\nThe initial sketch of proposed design is as follow:\r\n\r\n2.1 Advantages of proposed\r\ndesign\r\n2.1.1 Clarity\r\nTitle and subtitle: For the revised\r\nvisualization, users will be capable of understanding the objective of\r\nthe chart and visualization tool by providing a clear dashboard main\r\ntitle. And the added subtitle will emphasize some of the chart’s most\r\nimportant findings.\r\nChart type: We can change the adjacency matrix\r\nto the choropleth map. A choropleth map is a type of thematic map in\r\nwhich areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to a statistical\r\nvariable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic\r\ncharacteristic within each area. For example, we can find out which\r\ncommunity has the largest proportion of trips. In addition, because we\r\ncan observe the adjacent zone by eyes so the legend order is no\r\nmatter.\r\nData Source: The revised one add data source at\r\nfoot of visualization to be more reliable.\r\nAnnamination: The revised one add anamination\r\nfor origins and destinations for barchart, and the annamination of map\r\nfrom time to time. It can help users to identify the change and the\r\ndifferences more easily.\r\n2.2 Aesthetics\r\nColor: Different colors will be used for the map\r\nand bar charts about the trips generated from and attracted to a certain\r\nsub-zone, so that users can recognize the difference with only a look.\r\nUsing distinct colors to symbolize two separate situations will also\r\nmake it more aesthetically attractive.\r\nProper Layout: The revised one ensure all the\r\nmap and bar charts are aligned to be more valuable aesthetics.\r\nAnnamination: The annamination make the\r\nvisulization more attractive and beautiful, and also do not need so much\r\norigin and destination filters which make the content\r\nrepetition.\r\nProposed Visualisation on\r\nTableau\r\nPlease view the proposed visualization on Tableau Public here\r\n\r\n4. Step-By-Step Preparation\r\nNo\r\nStep\r\nAction\r\n1\r\nOpen tableau, drag data files\r\nMP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL.shp and\r\n*origin_destination_bus__SZ_202201.csv* into the open panel.\r\n\r\n2\r\nCreate a relationship between the two\r\nfiles by Subzone N in the shape file equals to the Destination Sz in the\r\ncsv file.\r\n\r\n3\r\nRight click the worksheet and convert the\r\nattribute Time Per Hour to Dimension.\r\n\r\n4\r\nDrag time per hour to columns, day type\r\nand total trips to rows. Then drag time per hour and origin sz to\r\nfilters.\r\n\r\n5\r\nRight click Origin Sz under filters, click\r\nshow filter, choose single value (list).\r\n\r\n6\r\nPress control and right click weekday and\r\nweekends/holidays on the vertical axis, choose rotate label.\r\n\r\n7\r\nRight click the total trips and select\r\nedit the axis.\r\n\r\n8\r\nFind the axis title and delete the\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n9\r\nDrag the Origin Sz to the pages\r\nto get the annaminations.\r\n\r\n10\r\nDouble click the chart title and edit to\r\nTrips Generated From  at Different Time and subtitle\r\nto The most number of trips generated from TAMPINES EAST. Then\r\nchange the color and font size as the screenshot.\r\n\r\n11\r\nRename the worksheet to\r\nOrigin.\r\n\r\n12\r\nRight click the Origin sheet then choose\r\nduplicate.\r\n\r\n13\r\nDrag the Origin Sz back and drag\r\nthe Destination Sz to pages and filiters.\r\n\r\n14\r\nRight click the Destination Sz in\r\nfilters to choose show filters and change to single value list as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n15\r\nClick the color, change to red.\r\n\r\n16\r\nDouble click the chart title and edit to\r\nTrips Attracted to  at Different Time and subtitle\r\nto The most number of trips attracted to TAMPINES EAST. Then\r\nchange the color and font size as the screenshot.\r\n\r\n17\r\nRename the worksheet to\r\nDestination.\r\n\r\n18\r\nClick to create new worksheet, drag\r\ngeometry to detail.\r\n\r\n19\r\nDrag Origin Sz to filters. Drag\r\nsum(total trips) to colour. Drag destination SZ to Detail.\r\n\r\n20\r\nRight click the Origin Sz in\r\nfilters to choose show filters.\r\n\r\n21\r\nRight click the Origin Sz and\r\nchange to single value list as before.\r\n\r\n22\r\nDrag the Time per hour to the\r\npages panel.\r\n\r\n23\r\nRename this worksheet to Choropleth\r\nMap.\r\n\r\n24\r\nClick SUM(total trips), select quick table\r\ncalculation, select percent of total.\r\n\r\n25\r\nClick colour, choose edit colors, change\r\nto red and select stepped colour, change opacity to 80%.\r\n\r\n26\r\nDouble click chart title, change to\r\nTrips Generated from  at  O’clock and\r\nsubttitle About 63.47% of trips from TAMPINES EAST to TAMPINES WEST\r\nand TAMPINES EAST. Then change the color and font size as the\r\nscreenshot.\r\n\r\n27\r\nRight click new dashboard to create a\r\ndashboard.\r\n\r\n28\r\nDrag the worksheet to the positions show\r\nin the screenshot.\r\n\r\n29\r\nSelect the button of show dashboard\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n30\r\nChange the dashboard title to\r\nSingapore Inter- and Intra-zonal Public Bus Flows January\r\n2022.\r\n\r\n31\r\nDrag the text to the dashboard below the\r\nbar charts, edit to *Data Source: https://data.gov.sg/ & https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html.\r\n* \r\n32\r\nLastly click the server, choose tableau\r\npublic and save as tableau public .\r\n\r\n5. Major Observations\r\nPublic bus services are used by short-distance passengers\r\n. According to the geovisual analysis, for bus travels, we may\r\nlearn about the basic destination distribution trends. The majority of\r\nbus services operate inside the same sub-zone or between neighbouring\r\nsub-zones in the same region. For example, if we choose origin sub-zone\r\nsuch as tampines east as shown below, we will see that 63.47% of bus\r\ntrips are serving destinations within tampines east and west.\r\nMore need of public bus services in weekday than weekends\r\nin general : No matter which orgin or destination subzone, the\r\ntrips number are much more in weekday than weekends. For example, the\r\ntrips are 202,067 to tampines east at 7am (the largest number in a day)\r\non weekday but 62,980 at 12am (the largest number in a day) on\r\nweekends/holiday. Therefore the bus services should plan according to\r\nthis situation to get better passengers experience and\r\ncost-benefits.\r\nBig difference between weekday and weekends in some\r\nspecific subzones: In central subzone and cecil, the trips at\r\n7am and 8am is extremely high than weekends or hoildays, and from the\r\nannamination the tampines subzone has more trips than other subzones.\r\nThe service should adjust the route plan and best choose those positions\r\nbetwwen communities which have more needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
